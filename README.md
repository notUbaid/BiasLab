\# BiasLab – Cognitive Bias Simulation Engine



\## Project Overview



BiasLab is a Python-based simulation system that models how cognitive biases influence human decision-making.



Beliefs are represented as probability values between 0 and 1. The system simulates how exposure to different psychological biases causes belief drift over time.



The project compares a Rational Model with a Biased Model to measure distortion effects.

\## Cognitive Biases Modeled



1\. Confirmation Bias – Individuals strengthen existing beliefs.

2\. Anchoring Bias – Initial information strongly influences future decisions.

3\. Availability Bias – Recent emotional events distort perception.

4\. Social Influence – Individuals adjust beliefs toward population average.
